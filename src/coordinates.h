/*
 * The Rubik's Cube group, usually just referred to as the cube group or G,
 * consists of the identity permutation and six face quarter turns
 * <L,R,F,B,U,D>. The group operation is the composition of permutations (i.e.
 * applying a sequence of moves to a cube state).
 * 
 * Consider the subgroup of the cube group where all corners are solved. There
 * are 8!*3^7 possible corner orientations and permutations, so the number of
 * cube states where all corners are solved is equal to |G|/(8!*3^7).
